the 1-3 rating system is based on [Net Promoter Score](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20231204). it's used by marketers to quantify word of mouth virality: how many people like your stuff enough to promote it (3s); how many will actively talk ill of it (1s); and how many won't say anything (2s).

there's an element of _active promotion_ here: you're actively bringing this up in conversations, you had such a good experience.
