please note that, traditionally, the 1-3 score comes from grouping 1-10 scores: 1 ≤ s ≥ 6 becomes 1, 7 ≤ s ≥ 8 becomes 2, s ≥ 9 becomes 3.

consider google maps: the real average is 4 stars. 5 stars means a place is really good, and anything 3 or less is suspect. even [professional reviewers](https://www.flannelfy.net/all_scores) fall into the trap. 1s and 3s talk about their experiences: a good enough place that can't generate enough 3s will slowly fizzle out and die.
