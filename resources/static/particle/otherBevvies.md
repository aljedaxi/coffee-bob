i'd roughly group them into two categories: stuff for non-coffee people, and stuff for coffee people.

if you're in the spro zone, there'll be something like the oat milk [dirty](https://europeancoffeetrip.com/dirty-coffee-recipe-milbok/) with a [gardenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardenia) syrup.

for non coffee people, there's usually something like a caramel macchiato; a couple things with matcha; something with houjicha. they're always great, but i wouldn't let them distract you from the pourover menu.
