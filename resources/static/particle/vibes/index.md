not my bag, but your milage will vary. Particle is currently in house 831. on weekdays, house 831 is a members only co-working space; on weekends, the bottom floor opens up, but upstairs is usually cordoned off for something members only. if the front is stuffed, there's probably space in the back.

most surfaces are flat white or light, exposed wood grain. dark green leaves, hanging vines, big open windows. all natural light. the walls are sparcely decorated with photographs of skate parks and oceans.

there's a truly lovely stoop out front. if you want to watch the traffic roll down 17th, there's no better place. for the cloud gazers, the patio in the backyard is gorgeous, usually empty, and dog friendly.
